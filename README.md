Python: Help, print, concatenation syntax, data types (str, int, float, bool) and <type>() to convert, naming variables, only store relevant data in variable (first_name = “Ben” not “Ben “) bc data is supposed to be used for many things like calculation etc

System analysis: different roles: analyst (what the system does), designer (how the system does it), dev, stakeholder (people with interest in process). Dev cycle: take requirements -> design -> implement -> test -> deploy, iterate when fail

Data: different hardwares: RAM is fast but lose storage when lose power. HDD uses mechanical arm and spinning disk, slow and permanent storage. SSD has no moving part, faster than HHD but slower than RAM, read is faster than write. File system limitations: no unification in file type and structure, no sharing, no recovery, no security. Database solves limitations: provides unified data types, same query language, shared access, recover and security

Computing: history: mechanical calculators and computers like abacus, pascal -> vacuum tube + punch card + machine language -> transistors + high level languages (fortran, cobol) -> integrated circuit (many transistors on small chip) + advanced languages -> microprocessor + advanced languages
